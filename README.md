# instant-messenger
Instant messenger is a messaging app that requires no sign-up. Just enter a username and talk to colleagues.

Certainly not an app to go public with!

Some interesting features:
- New messages sound alert when on a different browser tab. 
- Unread messages counter in browser tab.
- Messages with working links available.

To start the app run with cmd: **node index.js**

Built with Node Express - Socket.io and Vue.js.
